# Matlab code to extract edges from images and calculate similarity to manually defined edges

This code uses different algorithms manually calibrated in Matlab to have average/good edge detection performance on any type of content in an image. Then it uses another script to calculate the similarity score to edges manually defined by a human user throught the Matlab interface.
